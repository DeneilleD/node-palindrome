## How It's Made:
 
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,Node.js
 
 
I utilized my skills in Node.js, javaScript, HTML and CSS to make this interactive application using a server js file to act as a back end server yo determine whether a users input is a palindrome by turning the passed in string as a an array and analyzing the input that way was beneficial in handling/generating the response.
## Lessons Learned:
I learned 'A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specify and certain search pattern.'
